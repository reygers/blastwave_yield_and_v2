# Blaste-wave invariant yield and $v_2$
Computation of the blastwave invariant yield and elliptic flow coefficient v2(pt) for an elliptical freeze-out hyper-surface.

The code uses the root framework (https://root.cern.ch/)

Run it with

	root blastwave_yield_and_v2_sudden_freeze_out_in_r.C

In this calculation the freeze-out $\tau_\mathrm{f}$ time in a system moving along the beam axis is assumed to be independent of the radial coordinate.
